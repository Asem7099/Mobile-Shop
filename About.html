				MobileShop gives you a chance to quickly and easily find the phone you want and have it delivered to your home in no time
				We have been in the business for quite a while now, and it that time we have not only managed to make close relationships 
				with numerous suppliers all over the world, but also to recognize what people need. This means that we are always able to 
				offer all the latest phones, great prices, reliable service, fast delivery and premium customer support.
				MobileShop website was launched in 2001, but its story actually began some 8 years before that when a group of college friends 
				decided to go into business together. We started selling phones in shops, but our combined ambition, drive and abilities soon made 
				us look for new challenges and new markets. Starting an online shop provided for both and allowed us to develop a strong 
				international presence in a number of EU countries.
				Collective experience of our team members and the years we have spent in the business allowed us to develop a vast network of suppliers, 
				ensuring that our customers will always find what they are looking for. This also means that we are able to offer great prices, which are
				constantly being updated and follow the shifts in the market.</p><br>
